# Final-Project-Hadji-Guerou-Khegar-
Final project of Hadji Soudaisse, Guérou Rayane and Khegar Yanis in Python
    
    Project dealing with the creation of a model to predict the demand and the need for rents of bikes in Seoul. 
    The ultimate goal is to have an accurate prediction of when the clients need to rent the most and how many bikes are used at the same time to avoid conflict and use well the time of highs and lows.

    In conclusion, we found a model based on LGBM Regressor Model, that has a 0.78 R² score, making it very accurate on the questions we asked ourselves, making a prediction based on informations of the day, so that the company can handle the managment of their clients and bikes without getting an unpredicted rush, or a sudden break without renting at all.
